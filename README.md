IPL DATA (2008-2019)

Indian Premier League(IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India contested during March or April and May of every year by eight teams representing eight different cities in India. The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India(BCCI) in 2008.

I am not the greatest cricket fan out there but I enjoy cricket as much as the next guy.
Although I am a huge fan of Aaron Sorkin and his work.
If you are a fan of him like me you must be knowing what movie I am inspiring this from Moneyball(2011)



I was awestruck by such exclamations of formation of a best team with the help of some numbers on a sheet that might determine the players abilities.This sounded absolutely preposterous to me but with a little bit of cynicism I continued my research.



I was dumbfounded when I had found such determinations were possible and people were using such determinations to create fantasy teams on various sports and leagues.

PECOTA, an acronym for Player Empirical Comparison and Optimization Test Algorithm, is such a sabermetric system for forecasting Major League Baseball player performance. The word is a backronym based on the name of journeyman major league player Bill Pecota, who, with a lifetime batting average of .249, is perhaps representative of the typical PECOTA entry. PECOTA was developed by Nate Silver in 2002â€“2003 and introduced to the public in the book Baseball Prospectus 2003. Baseball Prospectus (BP) has owned PECOTA since 2003; Silver managed PECOTA from 2003 to 2009. Beginning in Spring 2009, BP assumed responsibility for producing the annual forecasts, making 2010 the first baseball season for which Silver played no role in producing PECOTA projections.

One of several widely publicized statistical systems of forecasts of player performance, PECOTA player forecasts are marketed by BP as a fantasy baseball product. Since 2003, annual PECOTA forecasts have been published both in the Baseball Prospectus annual books and, in more detailed form, on the BaseballProspectus.com subscription-based website. PECOTA also inspired some analogous projection systems for other professional sports: KUBIAK for the National Football League, SCHOENE and CARMELO for the National Basketball Association, and VUKOTA for the National Hockey League.

PECOTA forecasts a player's performance in all of the major categories used in typical fantasy baseball games; it also forecasts production in advanced sabermetric categories developed by Baseball Prospectus (e.g., VORP and EqA). In addition, PECOTA forecasts several summary diagnostics such as breakout rates, improve rates, and attrition rates, as well as the market values of the players. The logic and methodology underlying PECOTA have been described in several publications, but the detailed formulas are proprietary and have not been shared with the baseball research community.

We need such a public system for cricket to forecast the fantasy leagues that are popping up.

As a data science student and enthusiast I tried finding such projects whether existed on kaggle or even the data sets that needed for such projects on IPL.
I found no updated data.
As the new season of IPL is upon us I wanted to create a data set repository on which such determinations can be made.
As I am new to kaggle please guide me so that we can make this possible.
I will try to update the data as soon as possible.

Lets make this happen.
